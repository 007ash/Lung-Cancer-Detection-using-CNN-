# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN-

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for lung cancer detection is a powerful deep learning approach that helps automate the identification of cancerous growths in medical images, primarily Computed Tomography (CT) scans

## Key Steps Involved:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large dataset of labeled lung CT scans, including images with and without cancerous nodules.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to improve model robustness.
3. **Model Architecture**: Design a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from the images.
4. **Training the Model**: Train the CNN using the preprocessed dataset, optimizing the model's weights through backpropagation and using techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation dataset.
